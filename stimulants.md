## Where it all starts

Most newly-diagnosed people with ADHD, who have decided or been offered the path of medication, get the schpiel from a psychiatrist about stimulants. That they're a non-addictive, concentration-bringing, procrastination-slaying wonderdrug, and that without them you may as well go out back and shoot yourself rather than prolonging your jittery hyperactive under-stimulated life*. They tell you all the side effects, the pluses, etc etc, and then make the ever-so-funny remark of how you probably aren't concentrating on what they are saying because you are so inattentive. (They are probably right).

\* ok, _maybe_ a bit of an exaggeration. But to myself and many others it feels like stimulants are advertised as the only truely effective way of fighting ADHD.

Maybe if you raise concern over stimulants, you'll be presented with the mysterious "non-stimulant" option. Personally, I was not told anything more than it was a "long-term non-stimulant" medication. I wasn't given any names (atomoxetine (Strattera™) and gaunfancine (Intuniv™) are the only approved non-stimulant ADHD drugs in the UK - the US also has bupropion (Wellbutrin™)), nor the type of drug that this was - an SNRI (Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) for atomoxetine, an NDRI (Norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor) for bupropion, and an alpha-antagonist for guanfancine.

I very much left my appointment with my mind believing that stimulants were the only option I had for a *good* treatment for my ADHD. Yes, every psychiatrist and learning support teacher this side of the moon had told me that I could "utilise strategies and routines", but they always remained either painfully abstract or condescendingly childish. A 17 year old is not going to be helped much by being given a traffic light system for behaviour. Being told to divide tasks into smaller tasks and to provide rewards at the end of each task is advice every student on the planet has been given, and isn't enough to help with the severe execute dysfunction that often leads older teens and adults to seek ADHD diagnosis and help.

Even as I sit here, writing this, smoothly cruising on the bus with 60mg of lisdexamfetamine (Elvanse™/Vyvanse™) pulsing through my veins, I realise the irony of how I wouldn't be able to plan or write this without my stimulant medication. I'd be doing nothing, or just feeling frustrated at the length of this bus journey, and the incessant ballistic hum of the plasticky windows and the frustrating 
stillness of sitting and the fact I am definitely gonna be late and it's suddenly too hot and my head itches and just AAAAAAAAA- and then I realise I have missed someone trying to speak to me for a solid 10 seconds as I panicked over meaningless drivel and I have dropped my bag or something equally silly.


## The myth of "non-addictive" stimulant medication

For me, and at least several others I have talked to (although this is not a universal experience it seems), my psychiatrist really put emphasis into how non-addictive these medications were. This was reassuring to me, as while I havwen't ever had issues with drug or alcohol abuse, I knew addiction was more common and easier to slip into for people with ADHD[1-cite]. It gave me a sense of security about them. 

I play slightly fast and loose with the word addiction here, but there is reason to it. When I refer to the addictiveness of medication, I am not talking about serious addict level abuse to any of these medications, because that is no longer treating ADHD and is now simply a drug dependence.

## The good, the bad, and the ugly (and the depersonalisation)

Stimulants are not, as some people (myself included) seem to think when first offered them, a cure for ADHD. They are a bandaid for the symptoms which disrupt day-to-day life the most. For me, there are a few main aspects they help with:

* Executive function
* Coordination and motor skills
* Auditory processing
* Sensory regulation
* Memory

### Executive function

My most severe ADHD symptom is extreme executive dysfunction around starting tasks. Stimulants help _so_ much with this - I can decide to do a task, setup for said task, and then begin it relatively fuss-free, which is something that was simply unimaginable beforehand. 

Equally, but potentially suprisingly to some, stopping tasks is easier on the medication. Without it, once engaged in a task, it becomes difficult to stop for anything else. This can range from small actions like needing to go to the toilet, to larger ones like needing to leave for a commitment or to go and have dinner with family. While I still find them annoying and sometimes delay them more than I should, I find it significantly easier - and importantly, less disruptive - to stop my current task when needed. I can then smoothly carry out said task, and return to the prior one without much difficulty, whereas beforehand I would lose all concentration and be unable to return fully to it, an effect which likely compounded the issue by making me more reluctant to switch tasks.

### Coordination and motor skills

I have always struggled a lot with coordination, especially fine motor skills and timing (e.g being able to close my hand at the right point during a catch). I have a (well-deserved) reputation for being extremely clumsy, and knocking things over and injuring myself *frequently*.

The worst side effects are:

* Anxiety
* Appetite suppression
* Feeling "jaggedy", like one too many cups of coffee
* Paranoia
* Difficulty task-switching, especially on higher doses
* Comedowns
* Masks tiredness/sleep deprivation


The inevitable and constant unsolicited comments of how you "just aren't yourself" on medication from family members never helps, either.

## Interactions with alcohol

An interesting topic, particularly on the longest release medication (my LDX has a 13 hour duration!) and for younger people, is how these meds can interact with alcohol in a social context.
